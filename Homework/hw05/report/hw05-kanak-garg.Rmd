## Problem 1


```{r p1}
library(dieroller)
die = die()
total6 = 0
for( i in 1:1000){
  sim_4 = roll(die,4)
  total_six = sum(sim_4$rolls == die$sides[6])
  if(total_six > 0){
    total6 = total6 + 1
  }
}

print(sprintf("The total number of games where they were atleast one 6 is %s", total6))

print(sprintf("The relative frequency is %s", total6/1000))

1 - (5/6)^4
```

## Problem 2


```{r p2}

diedie = die()

total66 = 0
for( i in 1:1000){
  bool = FALSE
  for(j in 1:24){
    sim_i = roll(diedie,2)
    total_six_2 = sum(sim_i$rolls == diedie$sides[6])
    if(total_six_2 == 2){
      bool = TRUE
    }
  }
  if(bool ==  TRUE){
    total66 = total66 + 1
  }
}

print(sprintf("The total is %s", total66))

print(sprintf("The relative frequency is %s", total66/1000))

1-(35/36)^24
```
