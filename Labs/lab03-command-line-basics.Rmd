## Basic Bash shell commands

The first part of the lab involves navigating the file system and manipulating
files (and directories) with the following basic bash commands:

- `pwd`: print working directory
- `ls`: list files and directories
- `cd`: change directory (move to another directory)
- `mkdir`: create a new directory
- `touch`: create a new (empty) file
- `cp`: copy file(s)
- `mv`: rename file(s)
- `rm`: delete file(s)

If you are using git-bash (i.e. your OS is Windows) you don't have the `man` 
command to see the manual documentation of other commands. In this case you can 
check the _man_ pages online:

[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html)


## Your turn

Write your bash commands in a text editor (NOT a word processor) and save them 
in a text file: e.g. `lab03-gaston-sanchez.txt`.

- Open (or launch) the command line
- Use `mkdir` to create a new directory `stat133-lab03`
- Change to the directory `stat133-lab03`
- Use the command `curl` to download the following text file:
```bash
# the option is the letter O (Not the number 0)
curl -O http://textfiles.com/food/bread.txt
```

- Use the command `ls` to list the contents in your current directory
- Use the command `curl` to download these other text files:
	- http://textfiles.com/food/btaco.txt
	- http://textfiles.com/food/1st_aid.txt
	- http://textfiles.com/food/beesherb.txt
- Use the command `curl` to download the following csv files:
	- http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/forestfires.csv
	- http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/Fisher.csv
	- http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/cars.csv
- Now try `ls -l` to list the contents in your current directory in long format
- Look at the `man` documentation of `ls` to find out how to list the contents in reverse order
- How would you list the contents in long format and by time?
- Inside `stat133-lab03` create a directory `data`
- Change to the directory `data`
- Create a directory `txt-files`
- Create a directory `csv-files`
- Use the command `mv` to move the `bread.txt` file to the folder `txt-files`
- Use the wildcard `*` to move all the text files to the directory `txt-files`
- Use the wildcard `*` to move all the `.csv` files to the directory `csv-files`
- Go back to the parent directory `stat133-lab03`
- Create a directory `copies`
- Use the command `cp` to copy the `bread.txt` file (the one inside the folder 
`txt-files`) to the `copies` directory
- Use the wildcard `*` to copy all the `.txt` files in the directory `copies`
- Use the wildcard `*` to copy all the `.csv` files in the directory `copies`
- Change to the directory `copies`
- Use the command `mv` to rename the file `bread.txt` as `bread-recipe.txt`
- Rename the file `Fisher.csv` as `iris.csv`
- Rename the file `btaco.txt` as `breakfast-taco.txt`
- Change to the parent directory (i.e. `stat133-lab03`)
- Rename the directory `copies` as `copy-files`
- Find out how to use the `rm` command to delete the directory `copy-files`
- List the contents of the directory `txt-files` displaying the results in reverse (alphabetical) order


### Optional challenge

If you are already familiar with the basic bash commands to 
navigate the filesystem (or if you want to expand your R skills), use the R 
functions to manipulate files and directories to perform the exact same tasks
from within R. See `?files` for more information.

- `getwd()`
- `setwd()`
- `download.file()`
- `dir.create()`
- `list.files()`
- `list.dirs()`
- `file.create()`
- `file.copy()`
- `file.rename()`
- `file.remove()`

# Git and GitHub Practice

> ### Learning Objectives
>
> * Create a GitHub repository
> * Create a local Git repository
> * Practice adding, and committing changes to your (local) Git repo
> * Practice pushing commited changes to a remote repo


### 1) Create a New GitHub Repository

- Open your browser and Sign in to your github account.
- Locate the `+` button (next to your avatar).
- Select the `New repository` option.
- Choose a name for your repository: e.g. `demo-repo`.
- In the __Description__ field add a brief description: e.g. "this is a demo repo"
- Use the default settings, and click the green button __Create repository__.
- You should see some content similar (but not identical) to the one below:

```bash
echo "# Demo Repo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/gastonstat/demo-repo.git
git push -u origin master
```

### 2) Create a local Git Repository

- Open the terminal (Mac Terminal, or Git-Bash for Windows users).
- Optional: change directory to your preferred location
e.g. your `Desktop`
```bash
cd Desktop
```
- Create a directory with the name of your github repo
```bash
mkdir demo-repo
```
- Change to the directory you just created
```bash
cd demo-repo
```
- Initialize the directory as a git repository
```bash
git init
```

It's possible that you encounter some error message, e.g. Mac users may get a 
message related with a missing component for `CommandLineTools`. If this your 
case, then type in the terminal console:

```bash
# Mac users may need to run this command
xcode-select --install
```

The command `git init` will set-up your directory `demo-repo` as a Git 
repository (NOT to confuse with your GitHub repository). This is basically
your __local__ repository.


### 3) Adding a README file

- It is customary to add a `README.md` file at the top level. This file must
contain (at least) a description of what the repository is about. The following
command will create a `README.md` file with some minimalist content:
```bash
echo "# Demo Repo" >> README.md
```
- So far there you have a "new" file in your local repo, but this change has
not been recorded by Git. You can confirm this by checking the status of the repo:
```bash
git status
```
- Notice that Git knows that `README.md` is untracked. So let's add the 
changes to Git's database:
```bash
git add README.md
```
- Check the status of the repo again:
```bash
git status
```
- Now Git is tracking the file `README.md`.
- Next thing consists of __committing__ the changes
```bash
git commit -m "first commit"
```

### 4) Adding a remote

Right now you have a (local) Git repository in your computer. And you also have 
a GitHub repository in your GitHub account. Both repositories should have the 
same name, and the goal is to link them. To do this, you need to tell Git that 
a _remote_ repository (i.e. the one in GitHub) will be added:

- To add a remote repository use the command below __with your own username__:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/demo-repo.git
```
- Verify your new remote
```bash
git remote -v
```
- If everything is okay, you should be able to see a message 
(with your own username) like this:
```
# Verify new remote
origin  https://github.com/username/demo-repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/demo-repo.git (push)
```

### 5) Pushing changes to a remote repo

- Now that you have linked your local repo with your remote repo, you can 
start pushing (i.e. uploading) commits to GitHub.
- As part of the basic workflow with git and github, you want to constantly 
check the status of your repo
```
git status
```
- Now let's push your recent commit to the remote branch (`origin`) from
the local branch (`master`):
```bash
git push origin master
```
- Go to your Github repository and refresh the browser. If everything went fine, 
you should be able to see the contents of your customized `README.md` file.
